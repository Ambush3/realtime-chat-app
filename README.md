Created from React, TypeScript, NextJs, TailWind, using Redis and Upstash for the database. 

Using your Google account, and one click authorization, you can sign up and login. 
From there, users can add each other, then decide if they want to accept or deny the friend request. 

After accepting, users can go back and forth chatting in real time.
If not in the main chat, a toaster notification will pop up to let the user know they have a new message. 

## Future Enhancements 
- Working on being able to send media (images at the moment) in the chat
